# The DATA Act Broker Repository

The DATA Act Broker repository is the API, which communicates to the web front end.

## Installation

For instructions on contributing to this project or running your own copy of the DATA Act broker, please refer to the [documentation in the DATA Act core responsitory](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-core/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.md "DATA Act broker installation guide").

## Project Layout

The repository has two major directories: scripts and handlers.

```
dataactbroker/
├── scripts/        (Install and setup scripts)
└── handlers/       (Route handlers)
```

### Scripts
The `/dataactbroker/scripts` folder contains the install scripts needed to setup the broker API for a local install. For complete instructions on running your own copy of the API and other DATA Act broker components, please refer to the [documentation in the DATA Act core responsitory](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-core/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.md "DATA Act broker installation guide").

### Handlers
The `dataactbroker\handlers` folder contains the logic to handle requests that are dispatched from the `loginRoutes.py` and `fileRoutes.py` files. Routes defined in these files may include the `@permissions_check` tag to the route definition. This tag adds a wrapper that checks if there exists a session for the current user and if the user is logged in. If user is not logged in to the system, a 401 HTTP error will be returned. This tag is defined in `dataactbroker/permissions.py`. Cookies are used to keep track of sessions for the end user. Only a UUID is stored in the cookie.

`AccountHandler.py` contains the functions to check logins and to log users out.

`FileHandler.py` contains functions for managing user file interaction. It creates all of the jobs that are part of the user submission and has query methods to get the status of a submission. In addition, this class creates downloadable links to error reports created by the DATA Act Validator.

In addition to these helper objects, the following sub classes also exist within the directory: `UserHandler`, `JobHandler`, and `ErrorHandler`. These classes extend the database connection objects that are located in the Core Repository. Extra query methods exist in these classes that are used exclusively by the Broker API.

## DATA Act Broker Route Documentation

### Status Codes
In general, status codes returned are as follows:

* 200 if successful
* 400 if the request is malformed
* 401 if the username or password are incorrect, or the session has expired
* 500 for server-side errors

After a successful submission this route will require
`confirm_email_token` to be called again.

### File Routes

#### GET "/"
This route confirms that the broker is running

Example input: None
Example output: "Broker is running"

#### GET "/<filename>"
This path will return files located in the local folder. This path is only accessible for local installs due
to security reasons.

Example Route `/Users/serverdata/test.csv`  for example will return the `test.csv` if the local folder points
to `/Users/serverdata`.

#### POST "/v1/local_upload/"
Input for this route should be a post form with the key of `file` where the uploaded file is located. This route **only** will
return a success for local installs for security reasons. Upon successful upload, file path will be returned.

Example Output:
```json    
{
   "path": "/User/localuser/server/1234_filename.csv"
}
```

#### POST "/v1/submit_files/"
This route is used to retrieve S3 URLs to upload files. Data should be either JSON or form-urlencoded with keys: ["appropriations", "award\_financial", "award", "program\_activity"], each with a filename as a value.

This route will also add jobs to the job tracker DB and return conflict free S3 URLs for uploading. Each key put in the request comes back with an url_key containing the S3 URL and a key\_id containing the job id. A returning submission\_id will also exist which acts as identifier for the submission.

A credentials object is also part of the returning request. This object provides temporarily access to upload S3 Files using an AWS SDK. It contains the following: SecretAccessKey, SessionToken, Expiration, and AccessKeyId.
It is important to note that the role used to create the credentials should be limited to just S3 access.

When upload is complete, the finalize\_submission route should be called with the job\_id.

Example input:

```json
{
  "appropriations":"appropriations.csv",
  "award_financial":"award_financial.csv",
  "award":"award.csv",
  "program_activity":"program_activity.csv"

}
```

Example output:

```json    
{
  "submission_id": 12345,

  "bucket_name": "S3-bucket",

  "award_id": 100,
  "award_key": "2/1453474323_awards.csv",

  "appropriations_id": 101,
  "appropriations_key": "2/1453474324_appropriations.csv",

  "award_financial_id": 102,
  "award_financial_key": "2/1453474327_award_financial.csv",

  "program_activity_id": 103,
  "program_activity_key": "2/1453474333_program_activity.csv",

  "credentials": {
    "SecretAccessKey": "ABCDEFG",
    "SessionToken": "ABCDEFG",
    "Expiration": "2016-01-22T15:25:23Z",
    "AccessKeyId": "ABCDEFG"
  }
}
```

#### POST "/v1/finalize_job/"
A call to this route should have JSON or form-urlencoded with a key of "upload\_id" and value of the job id received from the submit_files route. This will change the status of the upload job to finished so that dependent jobs can be started.

Example input:

```json
{
  "upload_id":3011
}  
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```
#### POST "/v1/submission\_error_reports/"
A call to this route should have JSON or form-urlencoded with a key of "submission\_id" and value of the submission id received from the submit\_files route.  The response object will be JSON with keys of "job\_X\_error\_url" for each job X that is part of the submission, and the value will be the signed URL of the error report on S3. Note that for failed jobs (i.e. file-level errors), no error reports will be created.

Example input:

```json
{
   "submission_id":1610
}
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "job_3012_error_url": "https...",
  "job_3006_error_url": "https...",
  "job_3010_error_url": "https...",
  "job_3008_error_url": "https..."
}
```

#### POST "/v1/check_status/"
A call to this route will provide status information on all jobs associated with the specified submission.  The request should have JSON or form-urlencoded with a key "submission\_id".  The response will contain a key for each job ID, with values containing dictionaries which detail the status of that job (with keys "status", "job\_type", and "file\_type").  

Example input:

```json
{
  "submission_id":1610
}
```

Example output:  

```json
{  
  "3005": {
    "status": "running",
    "file_type": "appropriations",
    "job_type": "file_upload"
  },  
  "3006": {
    "status": "waiting",
    "file_type": "appropriations",
    "job_type": "csv_record_validation"
  },      
}
```



## Test Cases

To run the broker API unit tests, navigate to the main project folder (`data-act-broker`) and type the following:

        $ python tests/runTests.py

Before running test cases, [make sure the validator is running](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-core/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.md#run-broker-backend-applications "run the DATA Act broker backend apps").

To generate a test coverage report from the command line:

1. Make sure you're in the main project folder (`data-act-broker`).
2. Run the tests using the `coverage` command: `coverage run tests/runTests.py`.
3. After the tests are done running, view the coverage report by typing `coverage report`. To exclude third-party libraries from the report, you can tell it to ignore the `site-packages` folder: `coverage report --omit=*/site-packages*`.
