# First step to deprecating BaseInterface, its children, and corresponding
# interface holders is to start moving all db access logic into one big
# file (to prevent circular imports and have everything in the same place).
# Still to do...make this work solely with a flask context...original idea
# was that these functions would only be invoked within a Flask route, but
# there are some (e.g., createUserWithPassword) that need to be here,
# pending a further refactor.
# As a temporary measure, until the next part of the work that refactors
# the db access within Flask requests, fire up an ad-hoc db session in
# these transitional functions.
