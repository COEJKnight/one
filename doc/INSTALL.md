# DATA Act Broker Installation and Setup

The easiest way to run a local DATA Act broker at your agency is to use our Docker image. Essentially, this image is a packaged version of the broker that is pre-configured and will run in an isolated environment.

If you're a developer who wants to run the broker on your machine and make changes to the code, please see the install directions in the project's contributing guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md "project contributing guide").

*TODO:* Add the docker instructions.
